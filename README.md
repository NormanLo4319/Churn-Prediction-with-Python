# Churn-Prediction-with-Python

In this repository, we explore how to build and analyze predictive models for customer churn using supervised machine learning algorithms in Python.

Customer attrition and also called "customer churn" is one of the most significant expenditures of any organization. Figureing out why a customer leaves and when they leave with reasonable accuracy, it would immensely help the organization to strategize their retention initiatives manifold.

Busniess Questions:

1. What is the likelihood of an active customer leaving an organization?
2. What are key indicators of a customer churn?
3. What retention strategies can be implemented based on the results to diminishing prospective customer churn?
